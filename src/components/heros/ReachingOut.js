            <h4>For Immediate Release - October 20, 2020</h4>
            <p>
              Official FURBABY video for the new single "Reaching Out (for
              Higher Ground)" out now.
            </p>

            <p>
              This tune asks, what is it about higher places? Why do living
              things climb mountains, build houses on hills, go to the top of
              the Sears tower in Chicago, or climb a tree? What do we get out of
              that vantage point, and why go there?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Armed with a cheap green screen getup, a wicked thrift-store
              fringe and some space videos from NASA's digital archives, Furbaby
              uses these rudimentary tools to see what's up. Outer space seems
              an increasingly decent alternative these days as well.
            </p>

              Ground).
